**HBmonitor is a "web dashboard" for HBlink by N0MJS.**

***This is version of HBMonitor V2 by SP2ONG 2019-2021***

The main difference between HBMonitor v1 and v2 is the layout, i.e. the main page shows condensed 
information and on the subpages, you can see the individual content that was shown on v1

I recommend not running HBmonitor on the same computer as HBlink3

HBmonitor tested on Debian v9 and v10

This version of HBMonv2 requires a web server like apache2, lighttpd and 
php support running on the server. 


    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/sp2ong/HBMonv2.git
    cd HBMonv2
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    cp config-SAMPLE.py config.py
    edit config.py and change what you necessary

    You need to copy the contents of the /opt/HBMonv2/html directory to 
    the web server directory. Suppose your web server is available 
    as http://dmrserver.org, copy the file to for example /var/www/html

    If you copy files to /var/www/html/hbmon, HBMonitor will be 
    accessible from http://dmrserver.org/hbmon

    You can copy to /var/www/hbmon and start HBMonitor access by configuring 
    virtual the web server for subdomains e.g. hbmon.dmrserver.org 
    the access will then be http://hbmon.dmrserver.org 

    In the html/include/ directory there is a config.php file in which you 
    set the color theme and name for your Dashboard. 
    
    In the html/include/config.php you can defined height of Server Activity 
    window: 45px; 1 row, 60px 2 rows, 80px 3 rows:
    define("HEIGHT_ACTIVITY","45px");

    In the html directory there is a buttons.html file that you can tune to menu keys 
    
    The logo image you can replace with file image in html directory  img/logo.png
    cp utils/lastheard /etc/cron.daily/
    chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/lastheard
    cp utils/hbmon.service /lib/systemd/system/
    systemctl enable hbmon
    systemctl start hbmon
    systemctl status hbmon
    forward TCP port 9000 and web server port in firewall
    
    Please setup your SYSTEM INFO subpage with the following instruction:
    
    https://github.com/sp2ong/HBMonv2/tree/main/sysinfo
    
    Please remember the table lastheard displays only station transmissions 
    that are longer than 2 sec.
    use >=0 instead of >2 if you want to record all activities in line:
    
       if int(float(p[9])) > 2:  

    If you want to have more than the last 15 entries in the Lastheard table
    change in the monitor.py file line from:
    
       # maximum number of lists in lastheard on the main page 
       if n == 15:
    to for example:
       if n == 25:
    
    
    I recommend that you do not use the BRIDGE_INC = True option to display bridge information 
    (if you have multiple bridges displaying this information will increase the CPU load, 
    try to use BRIDGES_INC = False in config.py) 
    
    
    ***************************************************************************************
    
    The HBMonv2 version without use external web server like apache2 etc is still available:
    
    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/sp2ong/HBMonv2.git
    cd HBMonv2
    git checkout webserver-python
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    cp config-SAMPLE.py config.py
    edit config.py and change what you necessary
    cp utils/hbmon.service /lib/systemd/system/
    systemctl enable hbmon
    systemctl start hbmon
    systemctl status hbmon
    forward TCP port 9000 and web server port 8080 in firewall
